# youtube-to-mp3-project
I made this app because I am sick of converters that only do one file at a time. Here you can do five at a time and search five more while those are downloading.

How to run this app:

1. Clone https://github.com/stevenfabrizio/youtube-to-mp3-project, install node and ffmpeg
2. cd server
3. npm install
4. npm run nodemon
5. Go to http://localhost:9000/
6. Copy and paste youtube links into the app
7. Check server/converted_files folder for MP3s!
