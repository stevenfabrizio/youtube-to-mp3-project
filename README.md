# youtube-to-mp3-project
I made this app because I am sick of converters that only do one file at a time. Here you can do five at a time and get five more while those are downloading.

How to run this app:

1. Clone https://github.com/stevenfabrizio/youtube-to-mp3-project, install node and ffmpeg
2. cd server
3. npm install
4. npm run nodemon
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/ in browser
6. Copy and paste youtube links into the app
7. Check server/converted_files folder for mp3s!

note: i'm not using front end stuff for now. just whatever is in the public folder.
